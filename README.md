Notes:
This app using JWT for user authentication. All endpoints of application (except endpoint for user creation) will tell that you need to authenticate first, so first you will need to:
1) create user: [POST localhost:3000/api/v1/users/]. Post body example: { "user": { "username": "John Doe", "email": "johndoe@gmail.com", "password": "0oK9Ij^uh", "password_confirmation": "0oK9Ij^uh" } }
2) authenticate user: [POST localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login]. Post body example: { "email": "johndoe@gmail.com", "password": "0oK9Ij^uh" }. You will recieve JWT token, copy it and use in "Authorization" header of all your requrests.
3) Now you can hit any provided endpoint with your JWT token in authorization header.
